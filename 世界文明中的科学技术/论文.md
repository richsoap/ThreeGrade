古罗马建筑师维特鲁威的巨著《建筑十书》论述了古典时期的建筑理念，直到今天其中的很多观点依然具有极高的参考价值。在维特鲁威的年代，罗马“街道弯曲而拥挤，不太稳定的多层住宅(有6到8层高)是用土坯砖砌成的，立面上还有木制的悬臂阳台。”


封建制度：还是以抓生产为主，劳民伤财的建筑容易出问题(京杭运河，阿房宫)

### 希腊早期建筑
There is a clear division between the architecture of the preceding Mycenaean culture and Minoan cultures and that of the ancient Greeks, the techniques and an understanding of their style being lost when these civilisations fell.[4]
Mycenaean art is marked by its circular structures and tapered domes with flat-bedded, cantilevered courses.[9] This architectural form did not carry over into the architecture of ancient Greece, but reappeared about 400 BC in the interior of large monumental tombs such as the Lion Tomb at Cnidos (c. 350 BC). Little is known of Mycenaean wooden or domestic architecture and any continuing traditions that may have flowed into the early buildings of the Dorian people.
The Minoan architecture of Crete, was of trabeated form like that of ancient Greece. It employed wooden columns with capitals, but the columns were of very different form to Doric columns, being narrow at the base and splaying upward.[9] The earliest forms of columns in Greece seem to have developed independently. As with Minoan architecture, ancient Greek domestic architecture centred on open spaces or courtyards surrounded by colonnades. This form was adapted to the construction of hypostyle halls within the larger temples. The evolution that occurred in architecture was towards public building, first and foremost the temple, rather than towards grand domestic architecture such as had evolved in Crete.[2]
