# Angle Modulation
## Frequency False Start
$$A_ccos[(\omega_c+km(t))t+\phi]$$
if k is as small as possible,$\delta \omega$ will very very small.<br/>
However, the result is a cos times a rectangle signal. Therefore, the frequency plot is not a delta, but a sinc.
The small rectangle signal is, the widther bandwidth is.
* carrier frequency is not bandwidth
## Basic Definition
* Basic carrier signal:$A_ccos(2\pi f_c+\phi)$
* Baseband signal:$m(t)$
* Frequency Modulation:$A_ccos(2\pi (f_c+l_fm(t))+\phi)$
* Phase Modulation:$A_ccos(2\pi f_c+\phi_0+k_pm(t))$
* $\omega=\frac{d\phi}{dt},\phi=\int\omega dt$
